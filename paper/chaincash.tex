In this paper we introduce ChainCash, a protocol to create money in self-sovereign way via trust or collateral, with individual acceptance.

\section{Introduction}

Currently, most of monetary value is created by private banks~(often, offshore banks as in so-called "eurodollar" system~\cite{machlup1970euro}) following central banks requirements. As an alternative, starting with Bitcoin~\cite{nakamoto2008peer} launch in 2009, a lot of cryptocurrencies 
and DeFi applications on top of public blockchains are experimenting with money issuance. As another alternative, we also have alternative, usually local, monetary systems, such as LETS~(local exchange trading systems), timebanks, local government currencies, and so on. Traditional fiat monetary systems usually possessed by big players~(with rich getting richer effect) creating money in non-transparent ways~(especially in offshore parts) without reasonable limits, on the other side, they have better supply elasticity. Cryptocurrencies~(and, sometimes, application and other tokens on top of public blockchains) are usually more decentralized, have known emission schedule, which makes them appealing assets, on the other hand, supply is disconnected from economic activity and not elastic. Local currencies usually considered more fair in segniorage distribution than fiat currencies, they are successfully boosting local economies often, but, in opposite to fiat and crypto-currencies, they are not global and universal.   \knote{add citations}

In this paper, we propose \cc{}, a new global kind of money, with decentralized issuance, elastic supply, and also backed~(not necessarily though) by collateral.


We consider money here via its medium-of-exchange property. For existing currencies, there are usually many options to represent value, such as coins, paper or plastic banknotes, digital records in different ledgers, etc. For \cc{}, we define money as a set of digital notes, each has some nominal~(not fixed but arbitrary on our case). Value of a note is nominated in some existing unit-of-account, such as gold. Consider that an economy is consisting of known agents $a_1, ..., a_n$. Then we can define medium-of-exchange property of money via a set of agents accepting monetary objects~(i.e. notes). 

Usually, set of agents accepting money~(local or foreign currency) is fixed. That is, for every monetary object~(e.g. a note), an agent is accepting it as a mean of incoming payment, or reject. In opposite, for \cc{} money, similarly to~\cite{saito2003peer}, the set is individual for a note, so when agent $a_i$ sees a note $n$, it applies its personal predicate $P_i(n)$ to decide whether to accept the note or decline it. 

Then how notes are different in case of \cc{}? We consider that every note is collectively backed by all the previous spenders of the note. Every agent may create reserves to be used as collateral. When an agent spends note, whether received previously from another agent or just created by the agent itself, it is attaching its signature to it. A note could be redemeed at any time against any of reserves of agents previously signed the note. We allow an agent to issue and spend notes without a reserve. It is up to agent's counter-parties then whether to accept and so back an issued note with collateral or agent's trust or not. 

As an example, consider a small gold mining cooperative in Ghana issuing a note backed by (tokenized) gold. The note is then accepted by the national government as mean of tax payment. Then the government is using the note~(which is now backed by gold and also trust in Ghana government, so, e.g. convertible to Ghanaian Cedi as well) to buy oil from a Saudi oil company. Then the oil company, having oil reserve, is using the note to buy equipment from China. Now a Chinese company has a note which is backed by gold, oil, and Cedis. 

Agent's note quality estimation predicate $P_i(n)$ is considering collaterals and trust of previous spenders. Different agents may have different 
collateralization estimation algorithm~(by analyzing history of the single note $n$, or all the notes known), different whitelists, blacklists, or trust scores assigned to previous spenders of the note $n$ etc. So in general case payment sender first need to consult with the receiver on whether the payment~(consisting of one or multiple notes) can be accepted. However, in the real world likely there will be standard predicates, thus payment receiver~(e.g. an online shop) may publish its predicate (or just predicate id) online, and then the payment can be done without prior interaction.

We propose to implement \cc{} monetary system on top of a blockchain as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{} Blockchain provides instant solution for public-key infrastructure.
  \item{} Public blockchain allows for a global ledger solution with minimal trust assumptions~\cite{kya}.
  \item{} Global public ledger allows for simple analysis of the notes in existence.
  \item{} Smart contracts minimize trust issues in payment execution and redemption. If native blockchain currency and assets on top of it~(such as algorithmic stablecoins) used in reserves, trust issues in redemption could be eliminated at all. If tokenized real-world commodities and fiat currencies~(e.g. USDT) are used in reserves, redemption could not be completely trustless~(as smart contracts do not have power off the chain), but at least there is transparent accounting in on-chain part of redemption. 
\end{itemize}

We use Ergo as a Proof-of-Work blockchain to implement \cc{}, as it is built on minimal trust assumptions~\cite{kya}, and UTXO transactional model as well as AVL+ trees support are making notes implementation feasible.

\appendix{ErgoHack goals}

For the ErgoHack, the goal is to complete the paper, make contracts, tests, offchain trackers, testing transactions.

The state before ErgoHack is corresponding to commit d1da4efeff5224de205990b4dd9cf5463d883266 (in https://github.com/kushti/chaincash ), and includes Introduction section draft in the paper, and basic modelling code for \cc{} entities in Scala.
