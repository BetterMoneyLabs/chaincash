ChainCash on Layer2
===================

This article describes how ChainCash notes can be implemented on Layer2, which means a note can be created and 
transferred to any other ChainCash participant (possibly, multiple times) without blockchain transactions needed, and 
only redemption happens on Layer1, means blockchain transactions involved.

To issue a note with value *aliceNoteValue* and spend it to Bob immediately, Alice (which has layer1 reserve in a box 
associated with singleton token *aliceReserveId*) is signing record (zeroTreeHash, aliceReserveId, aliceNoteValue, bobReserveId), where
*bobReserveId* is Bob's reserve singleton token id, and *zeroTreeHash* is root hash of empty AVL+ tree. She transfers the record
along with the signature (offchain)

Then Bob can redeem it immediately, or pay Carol with it, with possible change allowed. For that, to pay Carol 
*bobNote1Value* (and pay back self *bobNote2Value* = *aliceNoteValue* - *bobNote1Value*), Bob is creating two records,
(firstTreeHash, bobReserveId, bobNote1Value, carolReserveId) and (firstTreeHash, bobReserveId, bobNote2Value, bobReserveId),
where *firstTreeHash* is hash of an AVL+ tree containing Alice's note signatures only (so it is hash of the initial tree with hash 
*zeroTreeHash* with Alice's signature for the first payment to Bob added).
