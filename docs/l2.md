ChainCash on Layer2
===================

This article describes how ChainCash notes can be implemented on Layer2, which means a note can be created and 
transferred to any other ChainCash participant (possibly, multiple times) without blockchain transactions needed, and 
only redemption happens on Layer1, means blockchain transactions involved.

To issue a note with value *noteValue* and spend it to Bob immediately, Alice (which has layer1 reserve in a box 
associated with singleton token *reserveId*) is signing record (zeroTreeHash, reserveId, noteValue, holderId), where
*holderId* is Bob's reserve singleton token id, and *zeroTreeHash* is root hash of empty AVL+ tree.
