SilverCents – a hybrid crypto currency
========================================

SilverCents are the on-chain tokens in a cryptocurrency run on the Ergo Platform, using the Basis protocol (CCIP-1). 
SilverCents are exchangeable one for one with constitutional silver dimes and quarters that are suitable for circulation, 
and there are billions of these coins, distributed widely throughout the USA. The point of exchange is at the point of 
business of the vendors that participate in the SilverCents economy.

The supply of SilverCents is determined by the participation of vendor entities and their customers. Vendors can mint 
new SilverCents by creating notes against reserves that are 50% collateralized by DexySilver and 50% collateralized by 
tokenized real-world silver, and by a promise to redeem any of their SilverCents for constitutional silver 
dimes and quarters, within certain guidelines.

Just like the actual junk silver, the SilverCents will circulate like an incompressible fluid in the local economies. 
In fact, it will be more liquid because customers carry their phones about all the time, but not silver quarters. 
Even if a Vendor redeems their issued SilverCents by returning junk silver to the customer, they can still spend their 
own SilverCents again, or sell them to customers to exchange for their product or service. The only way that SilverCents 
are destroyed is upon default, in which the requisite portion of the Dexy Silver collateral is distributed to the holders 
of those SilverCents, which are subsequently burned. In that event, the Vendor gets a default on their record, viewable 
by any other vendors in the system that hold their SilverCents from other notes. SilverCents will implement a reputation 
system for Vendors.

SilverCents could be traded online, and form the basis of an undercollateralized stablecoin for what that is worth. But 
the purpose of SilverCents is facilitate local circular economies based upon familiar tokenization and availability of 
constitutional silver dimes and quarters. SilverCents are for farmers markets, the county fair, food trucks, flea 
markets, handyman services, and other small local business markets. SilverCents makes it easier for the customers to 
pay with their phone, and makes it easier for Vendors to settle accounts with one another in silver coinage.
